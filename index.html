        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>We are seeking to fund a system of alternative transportation through rechargeable electric scooters in the city of Corvallis, Oregon. We plan to implement five charging and parking stations in and around the campuses of Oregon State University and the Benton Center with eight scooters at each station, making for a total of forty scooters. These scooters will be powered by a rechargeable battery and will be able to travel up to 20 miles at a cost of under two dollars per ride. The riders will unlock the scooter using an app on their phone and be able to pay for it through that as well. They will help reduce gasoline and CO2 emissions as well as improve sustainability in the social and economic dimensions for Corvallis. Oregon State and the Benton Center are the best options when it comes to community partners because Corvallis is a college town. With a population of around 57,000, the majority of people are in their 20’s and 30’s. This age group of people and the one below them are the most likely to take advantage of an alternative form of transportation like the one we are offering. These two colleges can help spread the word and implement our stations around Corvallis, giving us the best chance to succeed in the city we are in. </p>

        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>In our research, we have come across three very similar projects to the one we have designed ourselves. Our project is a wholistically an electric scooter rental system which has already been implemented in many different locations with companies like Lime and Jump. According to their website (2018) they have expanded into nine international cities and 74 U.S. cities and their company is valued at over two billion dollars. Lime scooters have a max of 15 MPH which would be safe for all bike lanes and is an appropriate speed for the communities we are targeting (college campuses, busy downtown area). According to Lime Scooter Rentals website (2018), “lime-S has a maximum range of 20+ miles, depending on usage” and the battery can be easily checked by tapping an icon on the scooter. This is reasonable because we could implement charging/parking stations every 20 miles apart so that there wasn’t a risk of people getting dead batteries.  It’s safe to say that Lime is doing successful and doing a good job at promoting healthy alternatives to driving while also reducing CO2 emissions into the air. We plan on essentially incorporating the exact same system into Corvallis while also partnering with organizations within Corvallis to best design and plan out the locations of scooter hubs and logistics. Since this is a college campus, we hope to promote this scooter system primarily to students as they are the ones that generally produce the most traffic within the city.  Hopefully by encouraging them to take a scooter to school, they’ll stop driving and no longer have to purchase parking passes or clog up the roads.

        <h2>Project Goals, Outcomes, and Objectives</h2>
        <p>Decrease vehicle usage in Corvallis by providing five locations of electric scooters and charging stations for public use. Our budget will allow for a startup of 40 units, meaning there will be eight scooters at each station. These five parking and charging stations will be located on Oregon State and Linn Benton Campuses and nearby areas, all within 20 miles of each other as this is the range of each scooter. We can track the usage and success of the scooters through monitoring the use of the scooters. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Provide an easy-to-use, cheap alternative method of transportation for the people of Corvallis to use. University students will specifically benefit from these electric scooters, as they are more affordable than Uber or Lyft and can replace walking as transportation. The success of these scooters can be tracked through various surveys and monitoring of data from hubs and the scooters themselves. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Contribute to the Sustainability Coalition Action Plan: “By 2020, community members will reduce per-capita gasoline consumption to 90 gallons annually, 50% below 2008 levels.” by contributing to action 2.1.1 “Expand hours, frequency, and range of city buses, and continue to offer fareless transit.” by providing a transportation service that can be utilized at any time.
