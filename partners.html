              <h2>Collaboration</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>The Corvallis Transportation Coalition Team will be our first partner for this project and they will help us with getting our parking and charging stations implemented around the city due to their higher volume of connections. Our proposal will be working towards achieving one of their goals of reducing carbon emissions and gasoline usage. They have provided information about electric scooters and sustainability concerns in the city of Corvallis that helped in our decision to partner with Lime Scooters. Lime Electric Scooter Rentals will be our second main collaborative partner for this proposal. They will help provide the scooters themselves as well as the parking and charging stations. We are partnering with Lime scooters because their main goals align with ours. According to their website (2018), “Lime’s goal is to charge our entire fleet with 100% renewable energy, and to neutralize our operations emissions by supporting carbon offset projects.” Valued at two billion dollars and still growing, they are the most profitable electric scooter business on the market right now to partner with. Their scooters cost riders under two dollars per ride and will be affordable for our target market. Our third and fourth partners are Oregon State University and the Benton Center. They will play the part of our community partners and will help spread the word about our electric scooter stations. We also plan to implement these charging and parking stations in each of the campuses and around them, which will require talking to transportation services and collaborating with them in the future.

                <h2>Community Partner Description</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The community partners we will be collaborating with are Oregon State University and the Benton Center. The efforts of these two schools align with ours in creating a better community for everyone in Corvallis. Oregon State and the Benton Center have also been making strides towards more sustainable campuses and are open to having these scooter racks on campus. By providing another method of transportation to the students of Oregon State University and the Benton Center, these educational institutions emphasize the importance of sustainability. One way that Oregon State University currently promotes sustainable living is through the use of bike racks. They promote a biking community by providing bike racks outside of every building. They also have rentable bikes that you can check out to use while on and around campus. This is similar to how our electric scooters would be utilized in Corvallis. The scooters can be returned to any charging station and promote an alternative, sustainable method of transportation.
