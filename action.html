        <h2>Justification</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our budget request has fallen at a grand total of $19,631.50 just less than $400 short of the maximum $20,000 limit to our request. We believe that this large of a request is not only justifiable but will also provide a huge value to our community. Having these 
          scooters readily available to students and other Corvallis locals would provide both our school and the surrounding area with and increase in sustainability and efficiency. Secondly this budget reflects not only a purchase but also a sustainable investment. As we wish to purchase the scooters and charging stations (“HUBs”) outright we will be able to use the same common pay-as-you-ride system to receive funds to repair the scooters and sustain the initiative long term. The cost to the user will be very low and affordable while still being enough for us to be able to keep the scooters on the streets as time goes on.</p>
          <p>
          Our purchasing decisions were made with all of the options as well as the limit to our budget heavily considered. After looking into the cost of partnering with other companies as other company's reputations we decided  to go with Lime Scooters as our primary vendor for the required products. We admired their success in other cities and their reasonable pricing. We chose the most sustainable solar charging option so that our project will require no power from other sources once the initiative is implemented. For our scooter option we chose the scooter that was the most affordable and durable to best conform to the overall longevity of the project. The Lime pay to ride system which we have selected will allow our project to be sustainable and provide no future cost to our initial financial supporters or anyone else.

        <h2>Project Evaluation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our project will positively impact the city of Corvallis and its community members. 
          Surveys can be used to determine what kind of people are using scooters and also gain feedback on how the users of the scooters are benefiting from the service. If our goals of providing an alternative, easy-to-use, two dollars per ride form of transportation to the population of Corvallis are met, then surveys and data will align with the success. These surveys will be online through a QR or quick response code that users will be able to easily scan on their phone cameras after using the scooters. We will place the code at all stations and after scanning it, it will bring people directly to a quick two or three question survey. These questions will ask if the user is satisfied and give the opportunity for advice from the city users. HUBs stats will also allow us to see how many people are using the scooters. We will be able to see where the electric scooters are being used the most via GPS, this can help determine if future hub locations are needed and where the best place around town would be to place new hubs.

            <h2>Lasting Impact & Maintenance Plan</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The long-term benefits of this project are extremely valuable.  Since Corvallis is a college town, there will be a constant circulation of individuals in our targeted areas.  Freshmen who move in replacing seniors who are graduating.  Generally, most things within Corvallis are reachable without a car.  If we can distribute the scooter hubs throughout Corvallis, we effectively remove the need to commute with a gas powered vehicle.  If we can reach destinations faster and safer, while clearing roadways and reducing carbon emissions, then everyone benefits and Corvallis becomes a more sustainable town.  With continued use, the project will persist after the grant period is complete and will be seen as a valuable component of transportation in Corvallis.  We are in the works of acquiring a grant from the City of Corvallis to provide initial funding for this project.  As we are partnering with Lime scooters for this project we can rely on their app to provide maintenance services.  Within their maintenance plans, they allow users to fill out a quick survey including pictures and match it with the specific scooter by its ID in order to efficiently provide services on site for all possible issues. </p>
