                      <p class="question">Qualifications and Experience</p>
                      <p>My part in the project is design/graphics and as part of that I’ll be designing and developing a website to help promote our project and to give it a very professional platform for presentation. I think I’m qualified to do this as I’ve been doing web development for a while and in that time have created a few web tools for OSU.  Additionally, last summer I researched the elements of community engagement in an open source community and believe that some aspects of that can be applied to this project as well.
                        </p>
                      <p class="question">Value for project</p>
                      <p> I hope to learn more about the logistics of implementing a large scale project such as this one, what makes a successful product and how to promote people onto an idea.  As a computer scientist creating software in the future, something that I’ll need to do is have a holistic view of the lifespan of a specific piece of software, it’s intended audience and how to hook people onto it.  While this project may be a little different, it consists of all the elements that I’d need to learn as a professional regardless.  For this project we’ll need to have a good grasp of all the logistics involved in implementing something of this scale, how to make it so that the scooters are actually used and how to promote the idea so that it gets funded.  This experience will help kickstart the skills I’d need as a professional in the field.          </p>

                            <p>My role in the project is to reach out to collaborators and plan who we will partner with in the proposal. My other roles include editing and timekeeping. I believe I am qualified to do this because I have taken many business classes and know how to communicate in a professional and timely manner. I have had seven team projects similar to this one and have played different roles ranging from operations to marketing and management. I am a flexible person but my strengths and experience lie in marketing. I plan to use this to partner with Oregon State University and the Benton Center to help promote our electric scooters.

                            <p class="question">Value for project</p>
                            <p> I hope to learn more about sustainability in every dimension and how proposing a system of electric scooters can improve Corvallis. I am a marketing and management major and as a business student this project has already helped improve my teamwork and communication skills through working with my group. My professionalism and research skills will hopefully be enhanced as well as I have reached out to different collaborators for information and looked into many case studies. Overall, this experience will help me in the future because it is what I hope to do as a career one day. I hope to be able to design, implement and market a business of my own that improves the community.</p>

                            <p>One of my main roles is to oversee the accountability for everyone to complete his or her individual work and to assist anyone in need of help, if necessary. I feel as though my experience of playing recreational, competitive club, and now collegiate sports has contributed to my ability to work with others in a group or on a team. I have also developed leadership skills over the years from being the captain of multiple of the teams I have been a part of. Finally, my experience with environmental science provides a well-rounded understanding of sustainability and environmental impacts.

                            <p class="question">Value for project</p>
                            <p>  From this project, I hoped to learn how a group of individuals can propose and idea that can positively benefit the community. Environmental problems due to carbon emissions and other factors from motor vehicle use have become of increasing concern over the years. I would like to see how our project would actually impact the city of Corvallis if it were to be implemented. Because I am an environmental science major, in the future I hope I have the opportunity to work on similar projects to this one with a group of people who want to achieve the same goal.

                                <p> For this project my primary role is to be in charge of the budget and budget justification narrative. From this position I hope to use my communication and skills as well as my frugal attitude in order to prepare the most accurate and understandable budget description. My secondary role with this project is to assist Thien with the graphical/design aspects of our project. Using my design and artistic abilities I will create graphics and pictures that will enhance our projects understandability and overall value.  Coordinating with Thien, I will design the content, shape, and size of my graphics so they can be implemented seamlessly alongside Thein’s on the website. I would say that I am qualified for these roles because of my background in art/design and because of  previous experience preparing budgets for other projects. I believe that this project will help to improve my  communication and logistical skills in a team project setting.

                                <p> From this project I hope to learn more about how a project like ours is proposed and the amount of time and resources needed for this kind of initiative to come to fruition. Throughout this experience I wish to promote an entrepreneurial attitude and focus on my ability to be a flexible, objective based worker. I also want show that I am an effective team member and am able to listen to my teammates, taking feedback and implementing change to my work as needed. I am going into energy systems engineering. In the future I will likely be proposing real projects to my boss or client in a fashion very similar to this. I think for this reason that this project is very good and important practice that will relate to my career and future goals.

                            <p>My interest in this project comes from a background of studies in previous sustainability and business domains as well as a desire to not only better our community, but our world for future generations. I believe I am well qualified for this project because of my skills in business and experience in community projects. I have taken part in a variety of projects concerning the improvement of schools and community service programs. I am very technologically proficient and understanding of our global issues with a desire to repair them in creative ways. I also provide an outside perspective as I have lived within the target area as well as many different locations around the world collecting a wide spectrum of skills and knowledge to put forth into the project.

While I am currently focused on business and economics in my studies, this project will provide some insight into what goes into the process of brainstorming and ultimately producing a sustainable and efficient business. This project reveals a variety of methods to utilize working in a group environment and designated specizilations to each individuals strengths. I hope to be able to use this collection of methods and ideas in future projects and throughout my career as it involves working with other people.

                            <p>My interest in this project comes from my passion for technology and desire to utilize it to help people. My experience in technology comes from various projects and classes at OSU. I think my understanding of the electronics in the scooters can help aid in general decisions made in order to get the best outcome from our project. I also believe the writing experience from the various writing classes from OSU will be helpful in the proposal of this project, in particular WR 327 due to the grant writing experience I got through that class. Also, the risks assessment class I took will be helpful due to it’s look into environmental impacts and methods to analyze impacts.

                            <p> I hope to learn about sustainability, collaboration, and how to promote technology to the public. Learning about sustainability in terms of transportation and how our approach can benefit the environment as well as the community.  While doing this project I hope to grow my collaborating skills with my team, but also how to collaborate with companies like Lime scooter and OSU. I also look forward to learning how to promote sustainable technology to a general audience. I believe these things will benefit me in my career in electronics and technology.
