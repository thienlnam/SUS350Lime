            <h2>Dimensions of Sustainability</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Our project aims to promote sustainability in all aspects: environmental, social and economic. One of the most important goals of our project is to provide the community members of Corvallis, Oregon with an alternative more sustainable method of transportation. Today, there are increasing concerns from conservationists, policy-makers, and the public on climate change and global warming. In assessing the contributors to detrimental changes in the earth’s atmosphere, it is important to recognize how carbon emissions - from the gasoline consumption necessary to operate motor vehicles - add to these changes. Being said, by providing electric scooters as an alternative method of transportation, users will have the opportunity to participate in environmental sustainability, as carbon emissions and gasoline consumption will reduce. This will improve local air quality for local wildlife in addition to the local community. The local community should also expect to benefit economically having cheaper methods of transportation around the local area while also providing a new stream of revenue in the local market. We also hope in efforts to advertise our scooter project we’ll raise awareness to new forms of sustainable local transportation.</p>

        <h2>System Map Narrative</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This systems map considers the factors that have an influence on the success of our project: Lime Scooters to Corvallis. Our group has constructed a plan that would involve a partnership with Lime Electric Scooters. This partnership would lead to the introduction of Lime Electric Scooters to the city of Corvallis, Oregon - with the intent to provide a more sustainable alternative method of transportation to the traditional car. </p>
        <p>Key organizations involved in this project and noted on the systems map are Oregon State University and the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition Transportation Team. Both of these organizations have identified the need for more sustainable transportation methods in Corvallis. On the systems map, there are three goals that the organizations would like to meet and two recognitions that should be upheld in years to come. Addressing this issue and working toward the completion of these goals would improve the quality of life for the people of Corvallis and the students of Oregon State University. Looking at one specific goal included in the systems map: “By 2020, single occupancy motor vehicle trips will be reduced by 20% below 2008 levels,” our project would provide the Corvallis community with an alternative method of transportation that could replace many trips that are normally taken by car (Corvallis Sustainability Coalition). The Corvallis Sustainability Coalition Transportation Team has recognized the need to use alternative methods of transportation for trips whose distance is not long enough to require a car. Oregon State University has also been acknowledged for its efforts in sustainable transportation practices and therefore would be a good organization to partner with for our project. By encouraging the use of electric scooters for commutes to and from campus, car congestion and parking lot capacities can be reduced. In regards to possible safety concerns for the use of the electric scooters, our project group could work with the Corvallis Police Department to identify potential problems and to conjure up solutions beforehand. Like with bikes, safety regulations can be established and enforced in order to ensure that the electric scooters are being used in a safe and responsible manner. 
        </p>
        <p>Both Oregon State University and the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition team are serving the community of Corvallis and the students of the university. Therefore, our project and its intentions align with the goals of the two organizations. With goals to improve the transportation habits of the people of Corvallis, these organizations actively work to improve their sustainability in this sector. Because of various efforts from both organizations, there have been positive trends that confirm improvements in the sustainability of transportation in Corvallis. 
        </p>
        <p>Considering several important voices for this project, it is necessary to cooperate with all stakeholders to best implement this project. In designing the plan for our project, it would be essential for my group to include the voices of the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition Transportation Team, Corvallis Police Department, Lime Electric Scooters, residents of Corvallis, and Oregon State University and its students and faculty. Though our target group consists of Oregon State University students, we cannot disregard the opinion of the general public on the introduction of these scooters to Corvallis. 

          As noted on the systems map, all of the parties listed previously must work collectively to meet the goal to improve the sustainability of transportation in Corvallis.
